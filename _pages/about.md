My broad research interests lie at the intersection of `Robotics`, `Machine Learning` and `Computer Vision`. My goal is to build general purpose robots that are task agnostic, can generalise different environments and seamlessly operate in the real world.

I recently graduated with a B.Tech from NIT Tiruchirappalli, India where I majored in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. Previously, I worked with the most incredible <a href='https://danielseita.github.io/'>Prof Daniel Seita</a> at the University of Southern California. My work involved leveraging the capabilities of Pre-trained foundation models for fabric manipulation tasks. 

As a part of my Bachelor's Thesis, I worked under Dr. Ankur Singh Rana to develop an integrated Game Theory and Reinforcement Learning approach to Electric Vehicle pricing and routing. Further, I also conducted research at the <a href= 'https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/comp_photolab/'> Computational Imaging Lab </a> at IIT Madras under Prof Kaushik Mitra on low-light image enhancement using U-net based architectures. 

During my undergraduate study, I was a part of the <a href='https://rmi.nitt.edu/'>Robotics and Machine Intelligence</a> club. This club nutured my love for robotics and helped me connect with several passionate roboticists at NIT Tiruchirappalli.
